Title: Simulate Selection And Crossing On SNP Markers
Authors@R: c(person("Kira", "Villiers", role = c("aut", "cre"), email="k.villiers@uq.edu.au"))
Description: Fast functions to simulate breeding programs on SNP markers. 
 Simulates random crossing, specific crossing, selfing, and doubling haploids.
 Simulates crossovers and tracks phase in meiosis. Offers a selection of 
 pre-made selection methods as well as an interface to develop custom selection
 functions in R.

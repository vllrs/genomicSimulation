#' Get data of all individuals that belong to a group.
#'
#' \code{see.group.data} allows you to extract the names, IDs, indexes, 
#' genotypes (as strings), breeding values, or parentage of group members as an R vector.
#' As long as the group is not modified in between calls, accessing any datatype 
#' will return a vector using the same ordering of group members, 
#' so this function can be used to construct tables of data, eg.
#' \code{data.frame("i"=see.group.data(3,"X"),"GEBV"=see.group.data(3,"BV"))}.
#' 
#' Multiple groups can be passed to this function. The function will still 
#' return a single vector of data. Data from each group will be concatenated in 
#' the order that the groups were provided to the function. That is, a call to
#' \code{see.group.data(c(4,8,1),"N")} will return a single vector of names, 
#' containing the names of members of group 4, followed by the names of members 
#' of group 8, followed by the names of members of group 1.
#'
#' @section Warning about indexes:
#' Deleting a group (\code{\link{delete.group}}) may cause the indexes of group members to 
#' change (as the positions/indexes that they are stored in the internal matrix may be
#' rearranged). Therefore, you must ensure that there is no call to \code{\link{delete.group}}
#' between loading indexes with this function and passing them to a function that takes indexes
#' as inputs (eg \code{\link{make.group}}).
#'
#' @param group a vector of integers: the group number(s) of the group(s) to
#' access data from
#' @param data.type a string that will be used to identify the type of data
#' to be extracted. String parsing is case-insensitive.
#' \itemize{
#' \item If the first character is 'N', the 'N'ames of group members will be extracted. 
#' \item If the first character is 'D', the pedigree I'D's of group members will be extracted. 
#' \item If the first character is 'X', the Inde'X'es of group members will be extracted. 
#' \item If the first character is 'G', the 'G'enotypes of the group members will be extracted.
#' \item If the first character is 'B', the 'b'reeding values/GEBVs of group members will be returned.
#' \item If it starts with "L", the values of a custom 'l'abel will be returned. The values 
#' will be shown for the custom label whose identifier is provided by the label parameter
#' (by default, the first custom label created).
#' The breeding values will be calculated according to the effect set whose identifier
#' is provided by the effect.set parameter (by default, the first set of marker effects loaded).
#' \item If it starts with "P1", 
#' the first parent of each group member is returned. If the parent has a name, 
#' its name will be what is returned, otherwise, it will be its ID.
#' \item If it starts with "P2", 
#' the second parent of each group member is returned. If the parent has a name, 
#' its name will be what is returned, otherwise, it will be its ID. 
#' \item If it starts with "ped", the full pedigree log of each group member is returned.

#' @param effect.set identifier for the set of marker effects to be used to calculate breeding values.
#' This parameter is only used if the data.type corresponds to a request for breeding values/GEBVs.
#' @param label identifier for the custom label to be viewed. This parameter is only used 
#' if the data.type corresponds to a request for viewing custom label values.

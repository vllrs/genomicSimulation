\title{Save the pedigrees of genotypes currently saved to the SimData}
\usage{
save.pedigrees(filename, group = NULL, type = "R")
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{A string containing a filename to which the output will
be written}

\item{group}{If not set/set to NULL, will print all genotypes.
Otherwise, if a group of that number exists, save only lines that belong
to that group.}

\item{type}{The printing format. Use a string starting with 'R' or 'r' 
to save in recursive format. Use a string
starting with 'P' or 'p' to save in parents-only format.}
}
\value{
0 on success. On failure an error will be raised.

\description{
Saves a record of the ancestors of genotypes
for which this data was tracked.

\details{
Two formats are available for printing pedigrees. 

The recursive format (type="R") recursively traces back and prints
all known parents in the ancestry of the genotype. It first prints the
ID of the genotype, followed by a tab, then recursively prints the pedigree
with format [name of genotype, or ID if no name exists]=([parent1],[parent2]).
(each of the [parent1] and [parent2] will follow a similar format if they
are not founder genotypes or other genotypes with unknown/untracked pedigrees.
One row in the produced file corresponds to the pedigree of one line. 
Genotypes produced by selfing or doubling haploids only show one parent 
(eg. F2=(F1), not F2=(F1,F1)).

Parents-only format (type="P") prints the line's name (or ID if it has none), 
then the two parents' names (or IDs if they have none) to a tab-separated file.
Even if both parents are the same this format prints two columns of parent names. 
Each row of the produced  file is the pedigree of a different genotype. 

Note that the parents-only format prints only the most immediate generation of 
parents of a line. Also note that these 'immediate parents'
are the genotypes from which the ones to be printed were generated (i.e. 
the immediate parents of the result of a call to \code{\link{self.n.times}} are 
the group passed to the \code{\link{self.n.times}} function, not the (n-1)th 
generation of selfing).

The file produced by this function when type="P" can be used as the 
parental.file parameter to \code{\link{find.crossovers}}.

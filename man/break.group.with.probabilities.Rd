\title{Randomly split all genotypes in a group between a set of buckets with provided 
probabilities.}
\usage{
break.group.with.probabilities(group, probabilities)
}
\arguments{
\item{group}{an integer: the group number of the group to be split}

\item{probabilities}{a vector of decimals: the probability a genotypes will be 
allocated to the first, second, third, etc. buckets.}
}
\value{
the group numbers of the new groups
}
\description{
Given a `probabilities` parameter of length n, n+1 groups will be created, with 
 1 - (sum of other probabilities) probability of being in the last group. If 
probabilities add up to 1, a warning will be raised but no extra group will 
be created.
That is, it is assumed that the sum of `probabilities` is less than 1, 
with the remaining probability falling towards a last group. The reason for this 
is that floating-point numbers have their imperfect accuracies, so we want to 
save the computer from having to guess if you meant a last probability with 
0.000001 probability or if you were trying to provide some decimals that added
up nicely to 1.
}
\details{
If the bucket capacities add up to more than 1, 
a warning will be raised, but  the function will still run. Note, though, that
genotypes are allocated to buckets using cumulative probabilities, so groups 
with cumulative probabilities of more than 1 will get no members.

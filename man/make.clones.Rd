\title{Creates a genetically identical copy of each member of a group}
\usage{
make.clones(
  group,
  offspring = 1,
  retain = TRUE,
  inherit.names = TRUE,
  give.names = FALSE,
  name.prefix = NULL,
  track.pedigree = TRUE,
  give.ids = TRUE,
  file.prefix = "",
  save.pedigree = FALSE,
  save.gebv = FALSE,
  save.genotype = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{group}{The group number from which to draw the parents of these
random crosses. If a vector, the parameters and breeding method 
(eg. random crossing) will be applied to each group number in the vector.}

\item{offspring}{The number of clones to make from each group member.}

\item{retain}{A boolean, repesenting whether to save the generated
genotypes to memory or discard them. You may wish to discard them
but save to file if you are generating too many crosses to save into
memory.}

\item{inherit.names}{Boolean, whether to give each clone the same name as the group
member from which it was created. Overrides give.names.}

\item{give.names}{A boolean representing whether or not to produce names
for the new genotypes generated. The names produced would have format [name.prefix][id]}

\item{name.prefix}{A string. If give.names is TRUE, the id is concatenated to 
this to produce the name of each new genotype.}

\item{track.pedigree}{A boolean representing whether or not to save the ids
of the parents of each new genotype to the new genotype's pedigree. If this is 
false, the new genotype's pedigree is unknown.}

\item{give.ids}{A boolean representing whether or not to allocate each new 
genotype an id. If this is FALSE, the new genotype is 'invisible' to pedigree trackers and
even if the pedigree of its offspring is supposedly tracked, the pedigree trackers
will not be able to identify the progenitors of its offspring. Furthermore, if it is
false and names are generated using give.names, all names generated in the same group will
be the same. Probably you'd only have this FALSE if you were discarding the results or worried
about id overflow.}

\item{file.prefix}{A string representing the prefix of files produced if save.pedigree=TRUE, 
save.gebv=TRUE, or save.genotype=TRUE.}

\item{save.pedigree}{A boolean. If TRUE, saves the pedigree in recursive format of each
generated genotype to the file with filename "[file.prefix]-pedigree". This is a text file. 
Generated genotypes are saved progressively (up to 1000 at a time), so if the 
full result of a crosser function call will not fit in memory, this setting can allow
you to still get results.}

\item{save.gebv}{A boolean. If TRUE, saves the GEBVs of each generated genotype to the
file with filename "[file.prefix]-eff". This is a tab-separated text file. 
Valuse for generated genotypes are calculated and saved progressively (up to 1000 at a 
time), so if the full result of a crosser function call will not fit in memory, this 
setting can allow you to still get results.}

\item{save.genotype}{A boolean. If TRUE, saves the SNP/line matrix in regular format
(generated genotypes as rows, SNPs as columns) to the file with filename 
"[file.prefix]-genome". This is a tab-separated text file. 
Generated genotypes are saved progressively (up to 1000 at a time), so if the 
full result of a crosser function call will not fit in memory, this setting can allow
you to still get results.}
}
\value{
The group number of the new genotypes produced, or 0 if none could be
produced due to an invalid parent group number being provided.
}
\description{
Copy the genotypes in a particular group.
Returns the group number of the group
that the clone genotypes were loaded into.
}
\details{
The function copies over the genotypes of the original group members exactly,
and applies metadata according to the optional parameters chosen.

If track.pedigree is true, each clone is labelled as having one parent, the individual
of which it is a copy.

The offspring parameter represents the number of clones produced from each 
genotype in the original group.

If inherit.names is true, each clone shares the name of its progenitor, regardless
of the setting of give.names. If inherit.names is false, then clones are either named 
or left nameless according to the usual give.names/name.prefix settings.
